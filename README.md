The game starts with 16 enemy space ships arranged in a grid.

4 barriers are spawned between the player and the enemy ships and can take a certain amount of hits before being destroyed.
![During](./SpaceInvaders/readmepics/during.PNG)
The enemy ships will move down towards the player, so the player must destroy all of the enemy ships before they kill or get past the player.

If the player kills all the enemy spaceships, a "You Won" screen will appear.
